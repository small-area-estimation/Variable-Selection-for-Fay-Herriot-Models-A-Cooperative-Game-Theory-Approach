# Variable-Selection-for-Fay-Herriot-Models-A-Cooperative-Game-Theory-Approach

This repository provides a reproducible example of the methodology proposed in the paper "Variable Selection for Fay-Herriot Models: A Cooperative Game Theory Approach". It includes a script (use_example.R) that illustrates how to compute the Shapley-based influence measure and apply the variable selection algorithm to a synthetic dataset. The dataset used corresponds to the Examples 1,2, and 3 presented in the manuscript.

The file Example.csv contains the variables used in the analysis. The columns indicate: the domain, the value of the target variable in the d-th domain, the sampling error variance, and the explanatory variables.
